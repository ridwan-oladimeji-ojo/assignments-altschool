            <p><strong>Alt School ID:</strong>ALT/SOE/024/0992</p>
            <p><strong>Biography:</strong></p>
            <p>
                Ridwan is first a human being, then every other thing. Professionally, he's a writer (as you've astutely noticed). Unprofessionally, he's a trained microbiologist (shh! Don't tell anyone). He enjoys good food. Lots of it, actually. Loves soaking up nature in his spare time. And he'd like to travel more.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Reason for Joining AltSchool:</strong></p>
            <p>
                I chose to join AltSchool because of its reputation for providing practical, industry-relevant skills that are highly sought after in the tech industry. The School of Engineering program offers a unique blend of theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience, which aligns perfectly with my goals of becoming proficient in software development and engineering. I hope to leverage this program to build a solid foundation in engineering principles, enhance my coding skills, and ultimately contribute to impactful projects in the tech industry. Additionally, Alt School's community and mentorship opportunities are invaluable assets that I believe will support my growth and development as an engineer.
